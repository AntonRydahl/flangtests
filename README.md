# Comparing Code Generation in `clang` and `flang-new`
This repository contains simple examples which have been used to compare the LLVM IR generated by the LLVM native `C` and `FORTRAN` compilers

## Compilation
The [`./src`](https://github.com/AntonRydahl/flangtests/tree/main/src)  folder contains `C` and `FORTRAN` source code that can be compiled with
```bash
make FC=flang-new CC=clang APP=file_name OPT=<-O0,...,-Ofast>
```
This will generate multiple output files. LLVM IR is stored in `./ir/`, bitcode in `./bitcode/`, object files in `./lib/`, and executables in `./bin/`.

## Calling FORTRAN Subroutines and Functions from C
The folder [`./cbindings_offloading`](https://github.com/AntonRydahl/flangtests/tree/main/cbindings_offloading) contains examples of how `FORTRAN` subroutines can be called from OpenMP target offloading regions in `C`. It is shown how functions and subroutines are called in different ways, and how the functions can be called by other names in `C`.
